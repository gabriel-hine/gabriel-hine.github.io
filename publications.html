									<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Representations of biometric traits to be used in automatic recognition systems are typically learned with the goal of obtaining significant discriminative capabilities, that is, generating features that are notably different when produced by traits of different subjects, while maintaining an appropriate consistency for a given user. Nonetheless, discriminability is not the only desirable property of a biometric representation. For instance, the mutual independence of the coefficients in the employed templates is a valuable property when designing biometric template protection schemes. In fact, managing representations with independent coefficients allows to maximize the achievable security. In this paper we propose different learning strategies to obtain biometric representations with the property of statistical independence among coefficients, while preserving discriminability. In order to achieve this goal, different strategies are employed to train convolutional autoencoders. As a proof of concept, the effectiveness of the proposed approaches is tested by considering biometric recognition systems using both finger-vein and palm-vein patterns.</td>

									<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Template protection is an issue of paramount importance for the design of secure and privacy-compliant biometric recognition systems. Template unlinkability, together with template irreversibility, is an essential requirement to properly guarantee template protection. In fact, it ensures that templates generated from the same trait, but used in different applications, cannot be linked to the same identity. This paper deals with the design of a system satisfying the unlinkability requirement. The robustness of the proposed solution is evaluated by exploiting methods stemming from the theory of stochastic optimization, as well as by using quantitative measures specifically proposed to characterize the unlinkability of biometric protection schemes. A case study using finger-vein biometrics is considered to test the proposed cryptosystem on non-ideal data. The proposed scheme guarantees 128 bits of security with acceptable false recognition rates in real-life conditions. Moreover, we provide guidelines to determine the parameters of the transformations to be applied to real biometric traits so as to ensure proper recognition, security, and unlinkability performance.</td>

In this work, we show how a haptic device can be used to acquire in-air 3D signatures, and provide the time-dependent position and orientation characteristics needed to effectively perform user verification. Dynamic time warping and hidden Markov models are here employed to compare samples acquired during the enrolment and verification stages. The recognition performance achieved when testing the proposed system on samples captured from 52 subjects testify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, a longitudinal analysis carried out on data from a subset of 21 subjects, for which two recording sessions have been taken at an average distance of four months, demonstrates that effective recognition can be performed even at long time distances from the enrolment.</td>

									<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this thesis, we developed techniques that enable to use biometric traits for authentication in an anonymous manner. At first glance, the concept of anonymous biometrics seems quite odd since biometric traits are closely linked to our identity. Moreover, the widespread adoption of biometrics in forensics, border control, surveillance applications have biased the general vision that users have if asked to show their biometrics. The basic idea behind anonymous biometrics is to do not use biometrics themselves as identifiers, but rather bind the biometric trait with a secret key that acts as the authenticator. The biometric trait becomes a factor of the authentication protocol that let the user reproduce the identifier that has been previously assigned to him. In this way, the authentication service provider does not need to know the biometric sample itself, or any representation of it. Because of the intrinsic noisiness of biometrics, classical cryptographic techniques are not suitable, and specific techniques, known as biometric cryptosystems, have been developed. In this context, we present a novel biometric cryptosystem obtaining perfect security, that is not leaking any information about the employed secret key from the knowledge of the data stored in the database. While similar methods have already been sought in the literature, the approaches proposed so far have been evaluated in terms of recognition performance under the unrealistic assumption of ideal statistical distributions for the considered biometric data. Conversely, in this thesis, we investigate the applicability of the proposed framework to practical scenarios while managing a trade-off between privacy and recognition performance. This goal has been achieved by introducing a class of transformation functions enforcing zero leakage secrecy, by designing an adaptive strategy for embedding the secret key bits into the selected features, and by developing a system parameters optimization strategy with respect to security, recognition performance, and privacy. Experimental tests conducted on real fingerprint data prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Another important aspect is to ensure the untraceability along different services. That means that we should be able to produce different identifiers starting from the same biometric trait, but these should be indistinguishable from identifiers originated by independent users. The vulnerability of our system to the linkability attack has been analysed and an enhanced system is proposed in order to counteract it. A frequently neglected aspect in cryptosystem design proposals and analysis is the impossibility to synchronise signals once they are encrypted. Any kind of biometric should be aligned before doing any comparison. That means that further auxiliary data must be stored as a reference. This could leak too much information making the cryptosystem design useless. In this context, we propose a novel translation-invariant representation for fingerprint minutiae.</td>

									<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, we introduce a novel translation-invariant minutiae representation based on triple correlation for fingerprint biometric recognition. In contrast with other fingerprint representations with translation-invariant characteristics, the proposed one does not lose any information about the original trait, with the only exception of its absolute position. Nevertheless, triple correlation would be of little use, in its native form, for signal processing applications, due to its high-demanding memory requirements. By exploiting the intrinsic sparsity of the treated minutiae, we propose a sparse implementation of the employed triple correlation, allowing its use in practical application and the definition of a suitable comparison algorithm here introduced. The performed experimental tests show the suitability of the proposed triple-correlation representation for fingerprint minutiae comparison.</td>

									<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, we introduce a novel minutiae-based matching algorithm for fingerprint recognition. The method is built on an elegant and straightforward mathematical formulation: the minutiae set is represented by a train of complex pulses and the matching algorithm is based on a simple crosscorrelation. We propose two different implementations. The first one exploits the intrinsic sparsity of the signal representing the minutiae set in order to construct an efficient implementation. The other relies on the Fourier transform to build a fixed-length representation, being thus suitable to be used in many biometric crypto-systems. The proposed method exhibits performance comparable with NIST's Bozorth3, that is a standard de facto for minutiae matching, but it shows to be more robust with cropped fingerprints.</td>

Alternative beamformers have been presented, offering higher performance at the expense of computational complexity, which has so far limited their practical real-time implementation. In particular, the Filtered-Delay Multiply and Sum (F-DMAS) beamformer, which adds the computation of signed square roots, absolute values and multiplications to DAS, was recently shown to be effective in improving resolution, dynamic range and overall image quality. In this work, we present the real-time implementation of the F-DMAS beamformer on the ULA-OP 256 research system. This is obtained through a reformulation of the F-DMAS algorithm that allows reducing its computational cost. Compared to DAS, F-DMAS images of a commercial phantom captured in real-time showed higher CR (up to +7 dB), better spatial resolution (up to 30%), but lower CNR (-40%).</td>

									<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: The discussion-board site 4chan has been part of the Internet's dark underbelly since its inception, and recent political events have put it increasingly in the spotlight. In particular, /pol/, the "Politically Incorrect" board, has been a central figure in the outlandish 2016 US election season, as it has often been linked to the alt-right movement and its rhetoric of hate and racism. However, 4chan remains relatively unstudied by the scientific community: little is known about its user base, the content it generates, and how it affects other parts of the Web. In this paper, we start addressing this gap by analyzing /pol/ along several axes, using a dataset of over 8M posts we collected over two and a half months. First, we perform a general characterization, showing that /pol/ users are well distributed around the world and that 4chan's unique features encourage fresh discussions. We also analyze content, finding, for instance, that YouTube links and hate speech are predominant on /pol/. Overall, our analysis not only provides the first measurement study of /pol/, but also insight into online harassment and hate speech trends in social media.</td>

									<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In the last years, several papers on EEG-based biometric recognition systems have been published. Specifically, most of the proposed contributions focus on brain signals recorded in resting state conditions, with either closed or open eyes. A common assumption is that the acquired signals are quasi-stationarity. In this paper, we investigate such property in terms of discriminative capability, and we analyze whether or not it holds throughout the entire duration of data collected over long periods. An extensive set of experimental tests, conducted over a database comprising signals collected from 50 subjects in three distinct acquisition sessions, shows that the most distinctive information of the brain signals is temporally located at the beginning of each recording.</td>

									<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: In this work, some possible procedures to extract both 2D and 3D palmprints from the same experimental 3D ultrasound image of the human palm are presented. The ultrasound system used to achieve the 3D images is composed of a CNC commercial pantograph, which moves a high frequency (12 MHz) ultrasound probe along its elevation direction to cover the desired area of the human palm. The ULtrasound Advanced Open Platform (ULA-OP) is employed as ultrasound imaging system.</td>

									<td colspan="6"><b>Abstract</b>: Biometric recognition systems, despite the advantages provided with respect to traditional authentication methods, have some peculiar weaknesses which may allow an attacker being falsely recognized or accessing users' personal data. Among such vulnerabilities, in this paper, we speculate on the hill-climbing attack, i.e., the possibility for an attacker to exploit the scores produced by the matcher with the goal of generating synthetic biometric data, which could allow a false acceptance. More in detail, we focus on multibiometrics systems and investigate about the robustness of different system architectures, both parallel and serial fusion schemes, against the hill-climbing attack. Nonuniform quantization is also evaluated as a possible countermeasure for limiting the effectiveness of the considered attacks in terms of recognition success rate and average number of required attempts without affecting the recognition performance.</td>
